        Hi, I'm Reagan! As a recent STEM graduate, my schedule was packed to the brim—study sessions, late-night projects, 
        and the occasional panic attack over a forgotten deadline. But through all the chaos, there was one thing that kept me grounded: 
        my love for good, wholesome food. The only problem? I couldn’t find recipes that ticked all the boxes—healthy, easy to make, and 
        could be prepped for the week ahead. Who knew cooking could be such a challenge when your calendar is bursting at the seams?
<br>
<br>
When I started creating my own recipes, I had three golden rules: first, quality ingredients—organic, 
fresh, and all the good stuff that would fuel my brain for all those late-night study sessions. 
Second, they had to be quick to prep. No one has time for recipes that require a 2-hour commitment after a long day of classes. 
And lastly, I needed generous portions. After all, a single meal that could feed me for a week is the dream when you're living that busy student life.
<br>
<br>
Now, let’s talk about my dorm kitchen—a place that could best be described as “charmingly crusty.” 
It was tiny, greasy, and probably more suited for reheating pizza than cooking anything gourmet.
 But despite these... creative challenges, I knew I could whip up something delicious and nutritious. 
 I just had to get a little resourceful—and maybe invest in a few more paper towels.
<br>
<br>
So here’s the deal: these recipes aren’t just for <b>STEM majors</b> or <b>dorm dwellers</b>. 
They’re for anyone who wants to eat healthy without breaking the bank, spending hours in the kitchen, or crying over spilled quinoa. 
With a little creativity and a pinch of optimism, you can make tasty meals that keep you fueled, happy, and ready to take on whatever life throws at you - whether that’s finals week or just another Tuesday.

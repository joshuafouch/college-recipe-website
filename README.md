## üßë‚Äçüè≠ Git Workflow

### Prerequisites
- All three of use should NEVER make changes to main branch!!
  - main branch should always be in tact, lest a big mistake destroys our website.
- All changes must go through feature branches and pull requests

### Creating a Branch
1. From GitHub Web UI: Click "New Branch" button
2. Ensure "main" is selected as the source
3. Give your branch a name

### Switching Branches
- In VS Code: Click branch name in bottom-left status bar
- Select desired branch from the dropdown

### Update your branch (Merge main into your branch)
- Terminal commands below:

1. `git switch main` to switch to main branch
2. `git pull` to pull current main changes

3. `git switch <name of your branch>` to switch to your branch
4. `git merge main` to update your branch according to current main branch
5. make your changes and edits in your branch

### pushing into your branch
1. Always do a `git status` to check which branch your in
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m "message"`
4. `git push`

- ‚ö†Ô∏è THERE WILL PROBABLY BE MERGE CONFLICTS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED
  - You can fix merge conflicts in the GitHub Web UI.

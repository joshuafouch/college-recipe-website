    <!--- Julia: added this below recipeStory because each recipe comes with a "story".
                    usually they're kinda annoying because you have to scroll throught them to get to the recipe
                    or you have to  hit the "jump to recipe" button. I actually think it would be really cool
                    if we added the recipe story at the bottom of the page. And we can say that was a design choice because students
                    are busy and we want to help them save time, not waste it stressfully scrolling through our site to get to what they actually want. -->
